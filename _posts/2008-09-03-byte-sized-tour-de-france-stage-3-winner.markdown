Maybe I can be a pro cyclist after all...  My wife and I have been following the Tour de France 2008 Stage 3 winner [Samuel Dumoulin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Dumoulin) for a while. We like to keep up with his achievements because he is similar in size to us. We all (myself, wife and Samuel Dumoulin) all stand about 5' 2" (5 feet 2 inches) tall and for my wife and I seeing someone who is similar in stature win such a stage and event is enough to keep us motivated. How cool would it be to meet him or even take a ride with him through France, Awesome! Way to go Samuel! Keep up the good riding.
