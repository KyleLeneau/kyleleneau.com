I just released my jMonthCalendar (the full month event calendar) with some new enhancements/fixes upon request.  The change log can be found [here](/portfolio/jmonthcalendar) along with updated samples and direct download. Fixes include: month name display in IE, isArray function not present in older version of jQuery, and new configurable first-day-of-week that the calendar starts on (Sun, Mon, Tue, etc).
