[Unit Testing](http://www.typemock.com/) ASP.NET? [ASP.NET unit testing](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php) has never been this easy.

Typemock is launching a new product for ASP.NET developers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the **ASP.NET Bundle** - and for the launch will be giving out **FREE licenses** to bloggers and their readers.

The ASP.NET Bundle is the ultimate ASP.NET unit testing solution, and offers both [Typemock Isolator](http://www.typemock.com/), a [unit test](http://www.typemock.com/) tool and [Ivonna](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx), the Isolator add-on for [ASP.NET unit testing](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx), for a bargain price.

Typemock Isolator is a leading [.NET unit testing](http://www.typemock.com/) tool (C# and VB.NET) for many hard to test technologies such as [SharePoint](http://typemock.com/sharepointpage.php), [ASP.NET](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php), [MVC](http://www.typemock.com/ASP.NET_unit_testing_page.php), [WCF](http://www.typemock.com/wcfpage.php), WPF, [Silverlight](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php) and more. Note that for [unit testing Silverlight](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php) there is an open source Isolator add-on called [SilverUnit](http://www.typemock.com/Silverlight_unit_testing_page.php).
