## Who I am

[![Me and Cody](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1166/720440046_7bec55b6f0_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/720440046/ "Photo Sharing")In
case you were wondering, not that I have any reason to believe you were,
*Haacked* is *not* my real name.

In the offline world, *(which some prefer to call the “real world”)*,
people tend to call me [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/ "home page")
*(pronounced, you guessed it, “hack”)* — unless of course they are
calling me more colorful names as is sometimes deserved.

*Haacked* is simply my [blogger
handle](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/12/what-is-your-blogger-handle.aspx "What’s your blogger handle?")
*(creative, eh?)*. I also go by [@haacked](http://twitter.com/haacked)
on Twitter

## What I do

I work at [GitHub](http://github.com/) doing whatever I can to
make it even more awesome.

## Why I do it

Ever since I first laid my hands on [my first
computer](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/06/my-first-computer.aspx "This was my first computer"),
a TRS-80, *aka Trash 80*, I’ve loved computers and all the wonderful
things you can make them do such as printing `Care to play a game?` in
an infinite loop.

While I love my day job, I also have a passion for managing and
developing Open Source projects. There’s something immensely satisfying
in working with developers all over the world on a common goal, and then
sharing that product with all comers.

## What I do for fun

![Sand Sharks](/images/SandSharks.jpg)What is it about American culture
that causes us to ask people *What do you do?* and mean *What is your
occupation?* rather than *What do you do for fun?*. And here I go
propagating that mindset by putting this section last.

Oh well. Read my blog for a while and you’ll find I’m fanatical about
playing soccer.

Living in beautiful Bellevue, WA, I take every occasion to go hiking and
camping. I’ve also been to [Burning Man](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/18/burningmanphotopedia.aspx/ "Burningman Photos")
three times, and would love to make it a habit if I could.

The picture above is from my first time at Burning Man, paddling away
from sand sharks.
