In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

## Who I am

## What I do

I work at [SmartThings](http://smartthings.com/) doing whatever I can to make it even more awesome.

## Why I do it

<!-- Ever since I first laid my hands on [my first
computer](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/06/my-first-computer.aspx "This was my first computer"),
a TRS-80, *aka Trash 80*, I’ve loved computers and all the wonderful
things you can make them do such as printing `Care to play a game?` in
an infinite loop.

While I love my day job, I also have a passion for managing and
developing Open Source projects. There’s something immensely satisfying
in working with developers all over the world on a common goal, and then
sharing that product with all comers. -->

## What I do for fun

<!-- ![Sand Sharks](/images/SandSharks.jpg)What is it about American culture
that causes us to ask people *What do you do?* and mean *What is your
occupation?* rather than *What do you do for fun?*. And here I go
propagating that mindset by putting this section last.

Oh well. Read my blog for a while and you’ll find I’m fanatical about
playing soccer.

Living in beautiful Bellevue, WA, I take every occasion to go hiking and
camping. I’ve also been to [Burning Man](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/18/burningmanphotopedia.aspx/ "Burningman Photos")
three times, and would love to make it a habit if I could.

The picture above is from my first time at Burning Man, paddling away
from sand sharks. -->
