As an active developer/engineer I find it rewarding to work on interesting projects. Having a side project to work on keeps my mind fresh with ideas and technologies. Not to mention that it is a great experience to learn something new and break tradition from day to day operations. Below are 2 projects I have solely worked. Each project has a dedicated home page for maintainability, as well as to provide room for code samples, screen shots, and demos.

If you have any questions about any of the projects, please feel free to contact me in the comments below or email at [kyle.leneau@gmail.com](mailto:kyle.leneau@gmail.com). I am usually always on the lookout for a new project or two, if you have something in mind or would like to see anything below expanded, don't be afraid to drop me a line.

### Quick Project Summaries:

**[jMonthCalendar](/portfolio/jmonthcalendar/)** is a basic full month display calendar that I wrote to learn [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and beef up on my JavaScript skills. The requirement of this project was to create full month view of a calendar that could display events and link out to an event details page.  This is much different than the usual small pop-up calendars that are found next to text boxes to aid user input. To see a demo and find out more [click here](/portfolio/jmonthcalendar/).
