Welcome to ByteCyclist.com. My name is Kyle LeNeau, I am the author of this site, idea, name, code, plugins, and anything else. I am a programmer from Minneapolis, MN who enjoys bytes (coding) and riding my bicycle thus the name bytecyclist.com. I am **The ByteCyclist**. This site is formed with the intent of getting my thoughts out to the world. Since I'm a developer you should expect code samples and ideas of mine along with any projects I might be working on. As a cyclist, who knows what will end up here, maybe some cool bike sites/links, rides of mine or anything else related to biking. Enjoy the content.
