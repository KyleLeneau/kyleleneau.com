During college I was big in to video editing and movie making. Since then priorities have changed to coding and life. I was cleaning up a hard drive I used back then and found one of my favorite creations. I'm sure I have one more video that I made/published, I just have to find it. All of the filming and editing was done by me, and all of the riders featured are friends of mine. Hope you enjoy!
