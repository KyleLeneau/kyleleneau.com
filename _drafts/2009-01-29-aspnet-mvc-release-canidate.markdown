If you didn't know already, ASP.Net MVC framework is int he release candidate stages. Wahoo!!!. As per usual ScottGu over at Microsoft posted insanely detailed remarks on the new features. [Check it out here.](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx). Some notable improvements that I have used and like thus far include NO MORE CODE BEHIND FILES (this is my favorite), shortcut's to switch between views and controllers, and "scaffold" like generation of views and controllers using the T4 template engine in Visual Studio.
